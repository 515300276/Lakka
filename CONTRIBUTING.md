### Issue Reports

**BEFORE you report a bug make sure you have tried the [latest nightly version of Lakka](http://sources.lakka.tv/nightly/). Your bug might be already fixed.**

If you are at all unsure whether it's a bug in Lakka or a problem with something else, post in the [Lakka forum](https://forums.libretro.com/c/libretro/lakka-tv-general)  instead. If it turns out that it is a bug, an issue can always be opened later.

If you are sure that it's a bug in Lakka  and you have not found a similar issue, open a new [issue](https://github.com/libretro/Lakka/issues) and try to answer the following questions:
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to happen?
- What happened instead?

**It is important to provide logs for debugging as part of your Issue. Instructions for generating logs can be found in the [Troubleshooting Lakka](http://www.lakka.tv/doc/Troubleshooting-Lakka/) documentation.**

Make sure to specify which version of Lakka you are using.

Feature requests are great, but they usually end up lying around the issue tracker indefinitely. Sending a [Pull Request](https://github.com/libretro/Lakka/pulls) is a much better way of getting a particular feature into Lakka.
